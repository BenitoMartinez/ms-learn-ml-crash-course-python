        "A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of neural network that excels when your data can be treated as a sequence - such as text, music, speech recognition, connected handwriting, or data over a time period. \n",
        "\n",
        "RNN's can analyse or predict a word based on the previous words in a sentence - they allow a connection between previous information and current information.\n",
        "\n",
        "This exercise looks at implementing a LSTM RNN to generate new characters after learning from a large sample of text. LSTMs are a special type of RNN which dramatically improves the model’s ability to connect previous data to current data where there is a long gap.\n",
